Embroidered touch lamp, bringing craft and technology together into the home ( work in progress ).

Light fixture for home or office made from ready made embroidery hoop, cloth, conductive thread, addressable LEDs and a micro-controller. The conductive thread is embroidered into a shape that creates two variable resistors (AKA potentiometers). When the user touches the embroidery, they bridge the gap between the conductor and resistor of the potentiometer, allowing the microprocessor to recognize a value that can be used to control the light (color, intensity, etc.)

Currently, the potentiometer is set to control the base color of a rainbow function that maps a pleasing range of color from warm to cold across the LED ring. Since there are two potentiometers, they can be set up to control different values, such as color and intensity.

Furthermore, since each LED is individually controllable, this setup allows creating context menus such as a function selector - a led could light up as a selector and by dragging the finger the user could select different options.

This project draws inspiration from traditional craft and home decor, taking decorative embroidery to a new level. I envision this object providing a warm and human interface in the home or office, for light or for more. This form factor can provide an excellent alternative to the cold modernism of modern smart interfaces, acting similar to Amazon Alexa or Google Home.
